# dynamic_calendar

This repository includes code to create a Streamlit web application that displays a dynamic calendar with bank holidays in Israel.  
The application allows users to select a year and view either a monthly calendar or a yearly calendar.  
The monthly calendar displays the selected month and highlights the holidays for that month.  
The yearly calendar displays all the holidays for the selected year.

The application also includes a 'Holidays' tab that displays a table of all the Bank Holidays for the 2024-2033 years.  
The table can be downloaded as a CSV file.

The data for the holidays is obtained from the website [calendar.2net](https://calendar.2net.co.il/annual-calendar.aspx).
