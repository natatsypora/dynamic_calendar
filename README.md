# Dynamic Calendar 2024-2033

This repository includes code to create a Streamlit web application that displays a dynamic calendar with bank holidays in Israel.   
The application uses Plotly for creating the calendar and displaying the holidays table.  
The application allows users to select a year and view either a monthly calendar or a yearly calendar.  
- the monthly calendar displays the selected month and highlights the holidays for that month  
- the yearly calendar displays all the holidays for the selected year

The application also includes a 'Holidays' tab that displays a table of all the Bank Holidays for the 2024-2033 years.  
The table can be downloaded as PNG and the file with holidays in CSV format.

 The application also includes a sidebar with today's date, current time and timezone.
